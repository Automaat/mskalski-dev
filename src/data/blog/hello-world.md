After years of learning in public via conference talks, open-source PRs, and a Polish podcast, I figured it's time to have a place to write longer-form thoughts.

## What this is

A place for things that don't fit neatly into a PR description or a conference slide deck:

- Deep dives into service mesh internals (eBPF, mTLS, traffic shaping)
- Observability patterns at scale — what actually works when you own 1,500+ services
- AI infrastructure: where LLM serving, agentic workflows, and model routing intersect with the networking layer
- Occasional notes from building multi-agent systems and MCP servers

## Who this is for

Primarily for me — writing forces clarity of thought. But if you're a platform engineer, a service mesh practitioner, or someone curious about where AI meets distributed systems infrastructure, you'll probably find something useful here.

## What's already running

If you prefer audio and Polish, check out [Głęboki Odczyt](https://www.youtube.com/@GlebokiOdczyt) — a fully AI-generated podcast covering CS milestone papers. 60+ episodes in.

Otherwise: subscribe via RSS, follow on GitHub, or just check back occasionally.
