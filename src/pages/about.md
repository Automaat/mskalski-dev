I'm Marcin Skalski — a platform engineer with 10+ years building distributed
systems at scale.

By day, I'm a core maintainer of [CNCF Kuma](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma)
service mesh and work on [Kong Mesh](https://konghq.com/products/kong-mesh)
enterprise product. I've authored 13+ architecture decision records, led
observability and performance initiatives, and spoke at
[KubeCon EU 2025](https://mskalski.dev/public_speaking/).

I write about **distributed systems**, **service mesh internals**,
**observability**, and increasingly about **AI infrastructure** — where
service mesh patterns meet LLM serving, agentic workflows, and model routing.

Previously Engineering Manager at Allegro (Poland's largest e-commerce), where
I built and led the Service Mesh platform team owning 1,500+ services processing
2M+ RPS.

## What I'm Into Right Now

- Leading Kuma 3.0 observability redesign
- Building multi-agent systems and MCP servers for fun — check my [GitHub](https://github.com/Automaat)
- Exploring where service mesh meets AI infrastructure
- Running [Głęboki Odczyt](https://www.youtube.com/@GlebokiOdczyt) — a fully
  AI-generated Polish podcast (60+ episodes) on CS milestone papers
